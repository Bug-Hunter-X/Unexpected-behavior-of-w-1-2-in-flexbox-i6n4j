```javascript
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4 w-1/2"></div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4 w-1/2"></div>
</div>
```
This code will not work as expected because the `w-1/2` utility class will only apply to the width of the content inside the div, not the entire div itself. The divs will not take up the entire width of their parent container.
